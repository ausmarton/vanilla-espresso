The most basic ExpressJS app in CoffeeScript built with Cake and tested with Mocha

This is a plain ExpressJS app, which was generated using the express generator. It isn't intended to do anything useful as an app, the sole purpose of it is to demonstrate the simplest possible setup of an ExpressJS app written in CoffeeScript with a simple build plan and a couple of dummy tests.
I have drawn almost all "inspiration" from [express-coffee by twilson63](https://github.com/twilson63/express-coffee)!
So, anyone looking for a more concrete example or a more real world use-case, do have a look at express-coffee.

## It is composed of the following:

1. ExpressJS (The app generated by express is translated to coffeescript)
2. Cake - for running the build, tests, and the server
3. Procfile - for deploying to heroku
4. Mocha - for the tests

## Usage:

To run the dev build and startup the server
```
cake dev
```

To run tests
```
cake test
```

Deploying to heroku is pretty much like any other app.
You can find a lot of information on the express-coffee repository about the usage since the Cakefile is mostly a replica of what's there.
